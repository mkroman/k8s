  model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

  # What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8
  # will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it
  # more focused and deterministic.
  # temperature: 1

  # The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion.
  max_tokens: 8192

  # The reasoning method of the model. This controls how thoughts and answers
  # are extracted from the API response.
  #
  # Options:
  # * `think-answer-tags` - response is formatted with <think></think> and
  #    <answer></answer> tags and are extracted.
  # * `none` or false - response is preserved as is.
  reasoning_method: none

  # An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where
  # the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
  # So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are
  # considered.
  #
  # It's recommended to use this or `temperature`, but not both.
  # top_p: 1

  # Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
  # whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
  # talk about new topics.
  # presence_penalty: 0.0

  # Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
  # their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's
  # likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
  # frequency_penalty: 0.5

  # List of messages used for instructing GPT.
  #
  # Each message has `content` which will be templated with Mustache.
  #
  # Available variables:
  # `message` - The message a user sent to the bot (not including the bot nick)
  # `rawMessage` - The message a user sent to the bot, including the bot nick
  # `channel` - The name of the channel the message was sent in.
  # `nick` - The nickname of the sender.
